* Solutions for [[https://adventofcode.com/2023/][Advent of Code 2023]]

In Clojure.

** Approach

In general trying for compactness of solution. Less interested in performance, readability, etc. And not going through a lot of packaging effort.

But also not trying to be overly clever; the code tries to match the problem closely. 

Also trying to come up with good abstractions that I can add to [[https://github.com/CANDELBio/multitool/][multitool]]. Everybody disses utility libraries, but I consider them something like a private toolkit of useful abstractions.
